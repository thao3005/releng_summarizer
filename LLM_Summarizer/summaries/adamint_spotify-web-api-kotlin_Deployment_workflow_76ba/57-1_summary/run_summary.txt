Description:
The overall workflow mostly succeeded with five jobs completing without issues. However, the first job named "1_release_android_jvm_linux_js (1)" failed due to a unit test failure in 'testEditPlaylists' during the ':testDebugUnitTest' task, leading to a build failure. No other jobs showed problems, and all other release and deployment steps completed successfully.

Recommendation:
Investigate the unit test failure in job "1_release_android_jvm_linux_js (1)" to identify why 'testEditPlaylists' is failing and fix the underlying issue. Once resolved, rerun this job to ensure the build passes and the full pipeline can succeed.
