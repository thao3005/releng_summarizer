- Job 1_release_android_jvm_linux_js (1): failed
- Job 1_release_android_jvm_linux_js: succeeded
- Job 2_release_docs: succeeded
- Job 3_release_mac: succeeded
- Job 4_release_windows: succeeded

Description:
This run had mostly successful jobs, with four out of five completing without any issues. However, the job "1_release_android_jvm_linux_js (1)" failed due to a test failure caused by a `kotlinx.coroutines.channels.ClosedReceiveChannelException` in the `testSearchMultiple` test within `SearchApiTest[jvm]`. All other jobs related to Android, documentation, Mac, and Windows releases succeeded without errors.

Recommendation:
Investigate the cause of the `ClosedReceiveChannelException` in the failing test of the "1_release_android_jvm_linux_js (1)" job. Focus on the `testSearchMultiple` test in the `SearchApiTest[jvm]` to resolve the test failure before re-running the pipeline.
