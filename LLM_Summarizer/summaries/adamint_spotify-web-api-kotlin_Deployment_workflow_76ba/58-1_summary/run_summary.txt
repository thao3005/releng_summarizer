- Job 2_release_docs: succeeded
- Job 3_release_mac: succeeded
- Job 4_release_windows: succeeded

Description:
All eight jobs in this run completed successfully. While there were warnings related to unused parameters, deprecated Gradle features, and a connection reset error during Kotlin daemon compilation in one job, these did not cause any build failures or prevent the jobs from succeeding. Overall, the pipeline run was stable with no critical errors.

Recommendation:
No immediate follow-up is needed since all jobs succeeded and no critical errors were reported. If desired, consider reviewing the warnings about deprecated features and connection resets to improve future reliability.
