Description:
All 14 jobs in the pipeline run completed successfully without any critical errors or failures. Some jobs had minor compiler warnings related to incompatible pointer types, but these warnings did not prevent successful compilation, linking, and artifact uploading. Overall, the build and release process was smooth and stable.

Recommendation:
No immediate follow-up is needed as all jobs succeeded and no critical issues were found. However, it may be worth reviewing the compiler warnings in the esp32dev, esp32_eth, and esp32dev_audioreactive builds to ensure they do not indicate any underlying issues.
