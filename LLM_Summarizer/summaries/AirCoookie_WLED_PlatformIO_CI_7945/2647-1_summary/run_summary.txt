Description:
All 14 jobs in the CI/CD pipeline run completed successfully without any critical errors. Some minor compiler warnings were noted in a few build jobs (esp32dev, esp32_eth, esp32dev_audioreactive), but these did not affect the build or artifact uploads. The environment gathering, build, and release preparation steps all finished without issues, indicating a smooth and healthy pipeline run.

Recommendation:
No immediate follow-up is needed as all jobs succeeded and there are no errors requiring investigation. Continue monitoring warnings in future runs, but otherwise the pipeline is stable.
