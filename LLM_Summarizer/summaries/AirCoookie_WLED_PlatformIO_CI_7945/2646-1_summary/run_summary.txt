Description:
All 14 jobs in this CI/CD pipeline run succeeded without any critical errors. Some compilation warnings about incompatible pointer types were noted in several build jobs (esp32dev, esp32_eth, and esp32dev_audioreactive), but these warnings did not prevent successful firmware compilation, linking, and uploading. The release creation also completed successfully. Overall, the run was stable and no failures were detected.

Recommendation:
No immediate follow-up is needed. If desired, the pointer type warnings could be reviewed later to improve code quality, but they do not currently impact the build success.
