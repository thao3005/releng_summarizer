Run 'AlfaazPlus_QuranApp_CI_fe8e\670-1' summary (2 jobs):
- Job 1_build (1): succeeded
- Job 1_build: succeeded

Description:
The CI/CD pipeline run completed successfully with both jobs finishing without errors. Although there were warnings about deprecated APIs and mixed AndroidX/old support library usage in the second job, these did not cause the build to fail. Overall, the run went smoothly with all main build steps passing.

Recommendation:
No immediate follow-up is needed. However, it is advisable to investigate and address the deprecated API warnings and the mixing of AndroidX and old support libraries to prevent potential issues in future builds.
