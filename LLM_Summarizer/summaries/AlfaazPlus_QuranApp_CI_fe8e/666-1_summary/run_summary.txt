Run 'AlfaazPlus_QuranApp_CI_fe8e\666-1' summary (2 jobs):  
- Job 1_build (1): succeeded  
- Job 1_build: succeeded  

Description:  
Both jobs completed successfully without any critical errors. The first job ran cleanly with no detected issues. The second job also succeeded with a "BUILD SUCCESSFUL" message despite warnings related to mixed AndroidX and legacy support libraries, as well as deprecated API usage. However, the expected debug APK artifact was missing and was not uploaded, representing a potential issue to address.

Recommendation:  
No immediate follow-up is needed regarding build failures since both jobs succeeded. Investigate the cause of the missing debug APK artifact in the '1_build' job to ensure that the build outputs are properly generated and uploaded. Additionally, consider resolving the mixed library references and deprecated API warnings to improve code quality and future compatibility.
