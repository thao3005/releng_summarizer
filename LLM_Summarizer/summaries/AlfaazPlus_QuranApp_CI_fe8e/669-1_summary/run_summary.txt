Run 'AlfaazPlus_QuranApp_CI_fe8e\669-1' summary (2 jobs):
- Job 1_build (1): succeeded
- Job 1_build: succeeded

Description:
Both build jobs in the pipeline completed successfully without errors. The only minor issue was a warning in the second build job about a missing debug APK artifact, but this did not cause the job to fail.

Recommendation:
No immediate follow-up is needed since all jobs succeeded. However, you may want to investigate why the debug APK file was not generated or uploaded in the second build job if that artifact is required.
