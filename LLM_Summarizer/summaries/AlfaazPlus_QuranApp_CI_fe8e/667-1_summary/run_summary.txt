Run 'AlfaazPlus_QuranApp_CI_fe8e\667-1' summary (2 jobs):
- Job 1_build (1): succeeded
- Job 1_build: succeeded

Description:
Both build jobs completed successfully with no critical errors. The first build job had no issues detected. The second build job also succeeded despite warnings about deprecated APIs and partially migrated libraries. One minor issue noted was the missing debug APK file for upload, but it did not cause a failure.

Recommendation:
No immediate follow-up is needed, but it is advisable to investigate the cause for the missing debug APK file in the second build job and address the deprecated API warnings in future updates.
