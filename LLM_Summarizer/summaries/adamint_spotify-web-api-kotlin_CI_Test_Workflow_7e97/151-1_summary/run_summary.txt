Run 'adamint_spotify-web-api-kotlin_CI_Test_Workflow_7e97\151-1' summary (2 jobs):
- Job 1_test_android_jvm_linux_trusted (1): succeeded
- Job 1_test_android_jvm_linux_trusted: succeeded

Description:
Both jobs in the CI pipeline completed successfully. The first job had some warnings, such as unused variables, a fallback to a no-op logger due to a logging class load failure, and the use of deprecated Gradle features, but none of these caused the build or tests to fail. The second job completed without any issues.

Recommendation:
No immediate follow-up is needed as both jobs succeeded and no critical errors were reported. However, it may be worth reviewing the warnings in the first job to improve future runs and eliminate the deprecated features and logging issues.
