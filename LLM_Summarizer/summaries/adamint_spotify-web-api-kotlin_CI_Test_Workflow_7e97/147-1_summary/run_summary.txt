Run 'adamint_spotify-web-api-kotlin_CI_Test_Workflow_7e97\147-1' summary (2 jobs):
- Job 1_test_android_jvm_linux_trusted (1): failed
- Job 1_test_android_jvm_linux_trusted: succeeded

Description:
This CI run included two jobs with the same name but different identifiers. The first job (1_test_android_jvm_linux_trusted (1)) failed because the Android Gradle plugin requires Java 17, but Java 11 was used, leading to a build failure during the plugin application step. The other job (1_test_android_jvm_linux_trusted) succeeded without any issues.

Recommendation:
Investigate the Java version configuration for the failing job (1_test_android_jvm_linux_trusted (1)) and update it to use Java 17 as required by the Android Gradle plugin to resolve the build failure.
