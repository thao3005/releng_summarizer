Run 'adamint_spotify-web-api-kotlin_CI_Test_Workflow_7e97\153-1' summary (2 jobs):
- Job 1_test_android_jvm_linux_trusted (1): succeeded
- Job 1_test_android_jvm_linux_trusted: succeeded

Description:
Both jobs in this pipeline run completed successfully without any critical errors. While there were warnings noted about unused variables and a missing SLF4J logger binding in one job, these did not cause the build or tests to fail. Artifacts were uploaded correctly, and job preparation steps ran without issues.

Recommendation:
No immediate follow-up is needed since all jobs succeeded and all core tasks completed successfully. If desired, addressing the warnings about unused variables and logger binding could improve the build quality and logging clarity in future runs.
