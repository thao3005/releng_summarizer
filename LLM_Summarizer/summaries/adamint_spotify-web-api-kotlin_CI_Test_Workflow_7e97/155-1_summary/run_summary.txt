- Job 1_test_android_jvm_linux_trusted (1): succeeded
- Job 1_test_android_jvm_linux_trusted: succeeded

Description:
Both jobs in this CI/CD pipeline run succeeded without critical errors. Although there were warnings related to unused variables and a missing SLF4J logger binding in one job, all tests passed and the builds completed successfully. No failures were observed.

Recommendation:
No immediate follow-up is needed since all jobs succeeded and there were no critical failures. However, consider addressing the warnings about unused variables and the missing SLF4J logger binding to improve code quality and logging.
