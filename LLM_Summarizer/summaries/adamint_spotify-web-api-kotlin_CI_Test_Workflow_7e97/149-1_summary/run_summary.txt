Run 'adamint_spotify-web-api-kotlin_CI_Test_Workflow_7e97\149-1' summary (2 jobs):
- Job 1_test_android_jvm_linux_trusted (1): failed
- Job 1_test_android_jvm_linux_trusted: succeeded

Description:
The workflow run included two jobs with differing outcomes. The first job, "1_test_android_jvm_linux_trusted (1)," failed due to a JVM target incompatibility between Java (target 11) and Kotlin (target 17) during the compile step. The second job, "1_test_android_jvm_linux_trusted," succeeded without any issues.

Recommendation:
Investigate and resolve the JVM target compatibility mismatch in the failing job, ensuring consistent Java and Kotlin target versions in the build configuration. The successful job does not require further action.
