- Job 1_build (7.0.x): succeeded

Description:
All three jobs in the pipeline run completed successfully without any failures. The build and test processes passed smoothly, with the only notable points being some warnings related to possible null references and obsolete methods in the 1_build (7.0.x) job. These warnings did not cause the job to fail.

Recommendation:
No immediate follow-up is needed since all jobs succeeded and there were no critical errors. However, it is advisable to review and address the warnings in the 1_build (7.0.x) job to avoid potential future issues.
