Description:
The overall run was mostly successful with 9 out of 10 jobs completing without issues. The single failure occurred in the job "1_Build FreeBSD," where two tests in the packages/binding folder failed due to SIGILL errors in optimize.spec.mjs and transformer.spec.mjs test files. All other build, test, and publish jobs finished cleanly with all tests passing.

Recommendation:
Investigate the SIGILL test failures in the "1_Build FreeBSD" job, focusing on the optimize.spec.mjs and transformer.spec.mjs tests. Ensuring these tests are stable and exploring possible compatibility or code issues on FreeBSD builds will help achieve a fully successful pipeline in future runs.
