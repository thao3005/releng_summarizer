Description:
This CI/CD pipeline run had 20 jobs, with the majority of "stable" build jobs failing due to consistent Rust compilation errors related to function pointer type mismatches in the `packages/binding/src/jpeg.rs` file. The main error was using functions with an "extern C" calling convention instead of the expected "extern C-unwind" convention. This issue caused failures across various target platforms including Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, and FreeBSD. In contrast, the supportive test and build jobs (non-stable, binding tests, and publish jobs) generally succeeded without errors.

Recommendation:
Investigate the ABI mismatch errors in `packages/binding/src/jpeg.rs` that are causing the stable build jobs to fail. Focus primarily on correcting the function pointer calling conventions from "C" to "C-unwind" in the affected source code. Fixing these issues in the stable build pipeline jobs (notably jobs 1_Build FreeBSD, 1_stable x86_64-apple-darwin, 2_stable windows-msvc, 3_stable windows-msvc, 4_stable linux-gnu, 5_stable linux-musl, 6_stable aarch64-darwin, 7_stable aarch64-linux-gnu, 8_stable armv7, 9_stable android, 10_stable armv7-android, and 11_stable aarch64-musl) should restore successful builds.
